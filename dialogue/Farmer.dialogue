Farmer: Either way, you wanted something. Let's get it over with.

				Farmer: I'd hope so. Otherwise I'm gonna be coming after you.

				Farmer: S-sorry. Nerves are getting to me. 
				- Do you know where he is now?

				- Anything else you wanted to add?
					Farmer: Nothing comes to mind. Oh! Maybe if you could chase the kids away?

				Farmer: I mean. Really? Isn't this just a waste of both of our time?
				- Just tell me what happened already. 
					Farmer: You aren't actually in league with her, are you?
					- Not at all. 
						Farmer: Great waste of my time. 
						Farmer: Goodbye
						=> DialogueEnd
					- Maybe a little bit.
						Farmer: Great use of my time. 
						Farmer: Good day. 
						=> DialogueEnd 
				- Fair enough, it is. 
					Farmer: Glad to hear you come to reason. Now leave me alone.

					- I mean kinda?

					- (Lie really well) Never told a lie in my life.
