[[insert Witch Description here]]
She regards you with keen eyes, eyes that know more than they let on. 
She appears like a bit of an outsider. perhaps she's looking for conversatoin?
- What's a lovely lady like you doing out here?
	Witch: Save your pretty words for someone else
	Witch: I'm not interested in bonding with a mortal. 
	Witch: If you are genuinly interested in my current affairs however...
- What are you up to?
Witch: I am taking a break from work. 
Her tone is cold, but not annoyed. 
Witch: Why do you ask?
- You're the kind of woman with a big story behing her. 
	Witch: And you want to hear that story I assume?
	Witch: Naturally, you're a bard. You want to hear every story. 
	- So, you are going to tell it?
		Witch: No, I don't think I will. 
		Witch: Don't get me wrong, You're right to ask. You should, it's your profession after all. 
		Witch: But I deal with powers beyond your understanding. 
		Witch: And sometimes, understanding can be undoing, if you get what I mean. 
		- I do, fully. 
		- I do, I think. 
		Witch: Good enough. 
		Witch: Now, farewell. If you have need of me, you will know where to find me. 
	- Why, you make it sound like something is wrong with that. 
		Witch: The mere pursuit of everything is vein and despicable in itself. 
		Witch: And your kind tends to be horribly annoying as well. 
		Witch: You have a talent for sticking your nose where it does not belong!
